    Parameters
    ----------
    func
        Function to be compiled.
    dynamic
        Whether to compile all conditional branches, regardless of inputs during first invocation.
    example_inputs
        Example of inputs to the function to be compiled.
        Required for torch in non-dynamic mode, unused by other frameworks.
    static_argnums
        The argument numbers which should be treated as static for compiling. Default is None.
    static_argnames
        The argument names which should be treated as static for compiling. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
        The handle to the newly compiled function.
